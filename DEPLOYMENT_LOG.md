# Kiara Note - Vercel Deployment Log

## Task Summary
Configure environment variables in Vercel project settings and fix deployment issues for multi-user GitHub OAuth web app.

## Environment Variables Required for Vercel
```
REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app
REACT_APP_GITHUB_API_URL=https://api.github.com
REACT_APP_GITHUB_PAGES=false
REACT_APP_DISABLE_OAUTH=false
```

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Package.json Homepage Configuration
**Problem**: App was configured for GitHub Pages deployment but deployed to Vercel
**Root Cause**: `"homepage": "https://ohansfav.github.io/kiara-note"` in package.json
**Fix Applied**: Changed to `"homepage": "."`
**Commit**: `7ededdb fix: update homepage configuration for Vercel deployment`

### Issue 2: GitHub Actions Deployment Conflict
**Problem**: Automatic GitHub Pages deployment was conflicting with Vercel deployment
**Root Cause**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` was triggering on every push to main
**Fix Applied**: Disabled automatic triggers, kept only manual workflow_dispatch
**Commit**: `04a3d09 chore: disable GitHub Pages deployment - using Vercel instead`

### Issue 3: Vercel Caching Old Commits
**Problem**: Vercel was building from old commit `9ddba6d` instead of latest fixes
**Root Cause**: Vercel caching mechanism
**Fix Applied**: Added small change to force fresh build with latest commits
**Commit**: `48ca396 chore: force Vercel to use latest commit with fixes`

## Current Status
- ✅ All fixes applied and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment disabled
- ✅ Package.json configured for Vercel
- ✅ New deployment triggered with commit `48ca396`
- ⏳ Waiting for Vercel to complete deployment
- 🔧 Fixed authentication loading state issue in AuthContext.js

## Issue Fixed: App Only Showing Background Color

### Problem
The app was stuck showing only the background color and not displaying the login component or other UI elements.

### Root Cause
The authentication context was not properly handling the loading state, causing the app to remain in a perpetual loading state and never progressing to show the login screen.

### Fix Applied
1. **AuthContext.js**: 
   - Improved the `useEffect` initialization logic to ensure `setLoading(false)` is always called
   - Added proper error handling in the authentication initialization
   - Fixed the `fetchUser` function to ensure loading state is properly reset in both success and error cases using a finally block

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Added proper cleanup of invalid tokens
   - Ensured the loading state is always set to false regardless of authentication outcome
   - Improved error handling for failed authentication attempts

### Files Modified
1. `src/contexts/AuthContext.js` - Fixed authentication state management
2. `DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md` - Added documentation of the fix

### Technical Details
The main issue was in the `fetchUser` function where `setLoading(false)` was only called in the success path, not in the error path. This meant that if authentication failed (e.g., with an invalid token), the app would remain in the loading state indefinitely. The fix ensures that `setLoading(false)` is always called in the `finally` block, allowing the app to proceed to the login screen regardless of the authentication outcome.

Additionally, the main `useEffect` in AuthContext was enhanced to properly handle initialization errors and ensure the loading state is always resolved.

## Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Updated homepage field for Vercel compatibility
2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Disabled automatic GitHub Pages deployment
3. `src/App.js` - Added comment to force fresh Vercel build

## Next Steps to Monitor
1. Check Vercel dashboard for new deployment completion
2. Verify build logs show commit `48ca396` (not `9ddba6d`)
3. Confirm no "hosted at /kiara-note/" warnings in build logs
4. Test live application functionality

## Multi-User Architecture Confirmation
The app is properly designed for multiple users:
- ✅ Each user authenticates with their own GitHub account
- ✅ Notes stored in user's selected GitHub repositories
- ✅ Proper state cleanup when switching accounts
- ✅ OAuth flow supports multiple GitHub accounts
- ✅ localStorage used appropriately for per-user sessions

## Local Storage Usage (Safe for Production)
- `kiara-theme` - User theme preferences
- `github_token` - GitHub authentication tokens
- `gitnote-draft` - Temporary draft notes
- All storage is client-side and user-specific

## GitHub OAuth Setup Required
Before deployment works fully:
1. Create GitHub OAuth App at: https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Set Homepage URL: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
3. Set Authorization callback URL: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/auth/github/callback`
4. Required scopes: `repo`, `user`

## Build Warnings (Non-Critical)
The build shows ESLint warnings but these don't prevent deployment:
- React Hook dependency warnings (cosmetic)
- Unused variable warnings (cosmetic)
- Deprecated package warnings (from dependencies)

## Current Git Status
```
48ca396 (HEAD -> main origin/main) chore: force Vercel to use latest commit with fixes
04a3d09 chore: disable GitHub Pages deployment - using Vercel instead
7ededdb fix: update homepage configuration for Vercel deployment
290bdc1 docs: Add comprehensive Vercel deployment guide
a440569 feat: Add Vercel deployment configuration
```

## Expected Final Result
Once Vercel deployment completes:
- ✅ App deployed from latest commit `48ca396`
- ✅ No routing warnings in build logs
- ✅ Proper multi-user GitHub OAuth functionality
- ✅ All recent code changes (past 4 days) live
- ✅ No deployment conflicts with GitHub Pages

## To Continue This Task
In a new task, mention:
1. "Continue from DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md"
2. Current Vercel deployment status
3. Any specific issues encountered
4. What aspect needs further attention
